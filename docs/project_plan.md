# Project Plan: Urban Carbon Footprint

Title: Modelling the Carbon Impact of Urban Habits: A Data-Driven Look at Everyday Sustainability in Amsterdam”

Goal: Analyse how lifestyle choices (transport, energy, diet) influence carbon emissions, and simulate how behaviour changes can reduce environmental impact

Questions to explore:
- How much CO₂ does an average week of commuting produce?
- What are low-emission alternatives in daily life?
- How do meat-based vs. plant-based meals affect emissions?
- What is the impact of driving vs. cycling?
